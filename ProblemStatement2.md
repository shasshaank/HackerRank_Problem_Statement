# Django REST Framework: Smart Query Cost Optimizer API

In this project, you are building a **Query Execution Service** where clients execute SQL queries against a database. Clients have a credit balance and are charged for every query they run.

The system must estimate the cost of a query, enforce budget limits based on the client's tier, and **safely handle concurrent requests** to prevent "double spending" (race conditions).

Here is an example of a request JSON object:
```json
{
  "client_id": "CLIENT_123",
  "query": "SELECT * FROM users JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.uid",
  "tier": "PREMIUM"
}
```

Here is an example of a successful response JSON object:

```json

{
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "remaining_budget": 80,
  "cost_deducted": 50,
  "message": "Query queued for execution"
}
```
The application should adhere to the following API format and response codes in QueryController (or views.py):

#POST /api/queries/execute/:

The request body will have a client_id, query, and tier.

Determine Cost: Check the query string. If it contains the word "JOIN" (case-insensitive), cost is 50. Otherwise, cost is 10.

Check Budget:

Standard Tier: Balance cannot go below 0.

Premium Tier: Balance can go down to -100 (overdraft allowed).

Execution:

If (Current Balance - Cost) is valid according to the tier rules: Deduct cost, update balance, and return status: "ACCEPTED" with code 201.

If budget is insufficient: Return status: "REJECTED" with code 403.

Optimization Hint:

If budget is insufficient BUT the query is missing the word "LIMIT", return status: "OPTIMIZATION_SUGGESTED" with code 200 instead of 403.

The implementation must handle concurrent requests safely.

Note: The message field in the response is informational only. The evaluation will NOT check the content of message. Only status, remaining_budget, cost_deducted, and HTTP status code will be validated.

Implementation Requirements:

Complete the execute_query method in views.py.

Concurrency: You must ensure that two simultaneous requests do not deduct budget based on stale data. Use database locking (e.g., select_for_update).

Atomicity: Budget updates must happen inside a transaction.

Do not modify the provided Client model structure.

Validation Rules:

client_id: Must exist in the database.

query: Must be a non-empty string.

tier: Must be either "STANDARD" or "PREMIUM".

Constraints:

1 ≤ concurrent requests ≤ 100

Cost calculation must happen in < 50ms

Budget integrity must be maintained under load

Cost Logic:

Complex Query: Contains "JOIN" -> 50 credits

Simple Query: Everything else -> 10 credits
