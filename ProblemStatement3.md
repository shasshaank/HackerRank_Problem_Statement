# Django REST Framework: Intelligent Audit Trail System

In this project, you are building a production-grade **User Management System** that requires strict auditability, data recovery capabilities, and concurrency control.

Your task is to implement a system where every change to a `User` record is automatically tracked, soft-deletes are supported, and records can be "rolled back" to any previous state using a comprehensive Audit Log.

Here is an example of a User creation request JSON object:

```
{
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "role": "MANAGER",
  "department": "Engineering"
}

```

Here is an example of a successful response JSON object:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "version": 1,
  "created_at": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"
}

```

The application should adhere to the following API format and response codes in `UserController` (or `views.py`):

**1. POST /api/users/**:

-   Creates a new user.
    
-   Must automatically generate a `CREATE` entry in the `AuditLog` table via Signals.
    
-   Returns status code **201**.
    

**2. PUT /api/users/{id}/**:

-   Updates user details.
    
-   **Optimistic Locking:** The request body MUST include the current `version`.
    
    -   If `request.version != db.version`: Return status code **409 Conflict**.
        
    -   If versions match: Update the record, increment `version`, and return **200**.
        
-   Must automatically calculate the difference (diff) between old and new values and store it in the `AuditLog` table via Signals.
    

**3. DELETE /api/users/{id}/**:

-   Performs a **Soft Delete** (sets `is_deleted=True`).
    
-   Must generate a `DELETE` entry in the `AuditLog`.
    
-   The record must NOT be physically removed from the database.
    
-   Returns status code **204**.
    

**4. POST /api/users/{id}/rollback/**:

-   Request Body: `{"target_version": 2}`.
    
-   Reverts the user record to the state it was in at `target_version` by reverse-applying audit logs.
    
-   Creates a new `ROLLBACK` audit entry.
    
-   Returns status code **200**.
    

**Implementation Requirements**:

-   **Models:**
    
    -   `AuditedModel` (Abstract): Includes `version` (int), `is_deleted` (bool), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
        
    -   `User`: Inherits from `AuditedModel`. Fields: `email` (unique), `name`, `role` (USER/ADMIN/MANAGER), `department`.
        
    -   `AuditLog`: Stores `model_name`, `object_id`, `action` (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE/ROLLBACK), `changed_by` (username), `diff` (JSON), `version_snapshot`.
        
-   **Middleware & Thread-Local Storage:**
    
    -   Django Signals cannot access `request.user` directly.
        
    -   The AuditLog must record the username of the person making the change. Note that auditing happens in Signals, which do not natively have access to the request object. You must implement a thread-safe solution to pass the user context to the signal."
        
-   **Signals (Automation):**
    
    - The system must automatically detect changes to model fields and save the difference (Old vs New) to the log whenever .save() is called on a User instance.
        
-   **Concurrency:**
    
    -   Implement **Optimistic Locking** using the `version` field to prevent lost updates.
        
**Constraints**:

-   Do not use third-party audit libraries (e.g., `django-simple-history`); implement the logic yourself.
